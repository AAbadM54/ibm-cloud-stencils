## Notes

1. To use the IBM Stencils with draw.io:  https://draw.io/?libs=ibm
2. Nongroup boxes are implemented as containers - subject to change depending on evaluation.
3. Template named ibm_vpc_architecture under Cloud is currently outdated.
4. When exporting diagrams to svg ensure that icons are included and white space is minimized.  Icons use a web reference and not included in the svg by default so if the svg will be used offline check Embed Images when exporting the svg.  To minimize white space select the entire diagram first then check the Selection Only and Crop when exporting the svg.
5. Copy Style and Paste Style only copy the style and not images (i.e. box tags) that are included in some of the styles.  To include everything, use standard cut-and-paste with Edit Style.
