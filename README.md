## Visio Icon Conversion (vssx folder)

Tentative (subject to change/review) conversion of IBM Cloud Icons from pptx to vssx for Visio 2013 and later.  This Visio version contains additional icons as needed for IaaS plug the new group icons.  

The list of names in the region and zone are intended to be edited to a single name or replaced with another name.

The color scheme is:
* Containers - blue (RGB 67, 120, 187 which is identical to 4378bb)
* Security - red (RGB 255, 0, 0) 
* Groups (non-security) - green (RGB 0, 136, 43)

Need to determine whether to provide vss files for Visio 2003-2013.  

## Visio Diagram Templates (vstx folder)

Template files are in the process of being converted to Visio from other tools including reference architectures from Paul Bahr.  Also working with draw.io support to fix problems with the export of draw.io templates to Visio. The list of names in the region and zone are intended to be edited to a single name by the architect.
