## Visio Icon Conversion (vssx folder)

Tentative (subject to change/review) conversion of IBM Cloud Icons from pptx to vssx for Visio 2013 and later.  This Visio version contains additional icons as needed for IaaS plus the groups.  

The list of names in the region and zone are intended to be edited to a single name or replaced with another name.

The color scheme is:
* Outer Containers - blue (RGB 67, 120, 187 or Hex 4378BB)
* Security Containers/Groups - red (RGB 255, 0, 0 or Hex FF0000) 
* Inner Groups (non-security) - green (RGB 0, 136, 43 or Hex 00882B)

Use the blue above for user text and lines if desired.  The master name is not included when the icons are dragged to the canvas.  To add text to the icons on the canvas, select the icon and start typing the desired text and change the text to the blue color above if desired.  The text will be placed directly below the icon which can mean that a line will obstruct the text.  To fix this, select the text, right-click and select Font, go to Text Block, and select solid color of white for the text background.

Need to determine whether to provide vss files for Visio 2003-2013.  

## Visio Diagram Templates (vstx folder)

Template files are in the process of being converted to Visio from other tools including reference architectures from Paul Bahr.  Also working with draw.io support to fix problems with the export of draw.io templates to Visio. The list of names in the region and zone are intended to be edited to a single name by the architect.
