## Visio Icon Conversion (vssx folder)

Tentative (subject to change/review) conversion of IBM Cloud Icons from pptx to vssx for Visio 2013 and later.  This Visio version contains additional icons as needed for IaaS plus the groups.  Need to determine whether to provide vss files for Visio 2003-2013.  

Color Scheme:
* Outer Containers - blue (RGB 67, 120, 187 or Hex 4378BB)
* Security Containers/Groups - red (RGB 255, 0, 0 or Hex FF0000) 
* Inner Groups (non-security) - green (RGB 0, 136, 43 or Hex 00882B)

Edit Steps:
1. Drag icon from stencil to canvas.  Note that the master name is not automatically included with the icon on the canvas.
2. To add text to an icon on the canvas, select the icon and type the desired text.
3. Resize text to Calibri 10 pt if desired to fit more text than Calibri 12 pt.
4. Change text to the blue color above if desired.  
5. If a line obstructs the text, select the text, right-click and select Font, go to Text Block, and select solid color of white for the text background.
6. If any of the text wraps to next line, select the text, select Text Block (Shift+Ctrl+4) under Connection Point under HOME, widen the text box and move the widened text box to be in the center under icon. 
7. Edit the list of names in the region and zone to the desired name or replace with another name.

## Visio Diagram Templates (vstx folder)

Template files are in the process of being converted to Visio from other tools including reference architectures from Paul Bahr.  Also working with draw.io support to fix problems with the export of draw.io templates to Visio. The list of names in the region and zone are intended to be edited to a single name by the architect.
