### Navigating the Ribbon

* iTdisable, uncheck Snap & Glue, put the icon where you want it, then go back and reenable Snap & Glue.
* If you don't have Snap & Glue in the Quick Access Toolbar at the top of Visio, go to File -> Options -> Quick Access Toolbar, search All Commands and add Snap & Glue to the Quick Access Toolbar.

### Adding IBM Cloud Icons
