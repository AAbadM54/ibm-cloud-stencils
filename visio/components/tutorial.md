5. Copy the contents of the templates folder ([vstx](../templates)  files) to the local templates folder.

### Navigating Visio

#### Snap & Glue
1. Snap & Glue is enabled by default and helps with aligning icons and drawing lines among other things.
2. Disabling Snap & Glue allows precise icon placement when an icon won't go where you want it because of alignment.
3. To disable Snap & Glue, select Snap & Glue menu in the Quick Access Toolbar, uncheck Snap & Glue, select OK and exit Snap & Glue menu, put the icon where you want it, then go back and reenable Snap & Glue.
4. If you don't have Snap & Glue in the Quick Access Toolbar, go to File -> Options -> Quick Access Toolbar, search All Commands and add Snap & Glue to the Quick Access Toolbar.

#### Lines & Text
1. Lines are added between icons using the Connector under Tools.
2. Lines can have additional angles added either by holding the shift key and dragging to break out the midpoint of the line with four new right angles, or by holding the control key to create a single angle of an arbitrary degree at the midpoint.
3. Weight, color, and arrows of lines can be customized under Shape Styles.  
4. Size and color of the icon text can be customized under Font.
5. Position of the icon text can be modified by selecting the Text Block (Shift+Ctrl+4) under Tools.

### Adding Objects

#### Groups
1. Add a group and resize as desired.
2. You can delete the group name to save space if desired.
3. You can place a logo on the group border if desired.  

#### Icons & Lines
1. Add an icon to your diagram and resize as desired.  
2. Add text to the new icon by clicking on the icon and typing the text.
3. Customize the size and color of the text under Font.  
4. To subscript or superscript, highlight the desired part of the text and press "Ctrl =" to make the highlighted text subscript or "Ctrl Shift =" to make the highlighted text superscript. 
5. If any of the text wraps to next line, select text, select Text Block (Shift+Ctrl+4) under Tools, widen and reposition the text box.  You can also move the text to other sides of the icon out of the way of lines.  When done unselect the Text Block by selecting the Pointer Tool under Tools. 
6. Add a line from the new icon to another icon by using the Connector under Tools.
